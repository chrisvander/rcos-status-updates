## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I created some proper error reporting on the login page, along with drop-down errors from the top if user/password are incorrect or failed. I also utilized Expo's SecureStore for login preservation. If the user logs out from within the app, the login is removed from SecureStore. Additionally, I restyled portions of the Settings page and made more layouts in Adobe XD.

## This Week's Plan

I plan to start laying out interfaces in the app based on the designs in XD.

## Anything Blocking?

No blockers currently.
