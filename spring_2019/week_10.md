## Last Week's Accomplishments

Prepared our presentation, created a demo branch, fixed some data so I'm not exposing personal information. Also bought schedj.com.

## This Week's Plan

Nothing else for the academic semester.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope!

## Notes

Since this is the last status update, figured I'd go over what happened for the semester. We successfully implemented:
- An initial NodeJS server
- Secure authorization, authentication, and route protection
- Cookie delivery to client
- Routes for:
  - Login
  - Logout
  - Grades
  - Weekly Schedule
  - Today's Schedule
  - Student name
  - Class status by CRN
  - Registration status
  - Hold status
- A React Native/Expo built native iOS/Android app
- Pages for:
  - Login
  - Grades
  - Feed
  - Schedule
  - Profile
  - Settings
- Navigation controllers
- Authentication
- Transactional data delivery
- User interfaces for all screens
- Translation functions to convert SIS classes that are in all-caps to standard capitalization
- Functions to handle normalizing font sizes for different screens
- Components for many UI elements
- Designs for screens that don't yet exist

All of this is evident in the number of commits made and the vast codebase that we're now running with. Hopefully in the future I can make portions of this more modular. Overall, I'm very satisfied with where the project ended up.
