## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I laid out interfaces in Adobe XD for the Schedule and Profile pages. I also added Course Registration status to the Feed page, and added a transactional system to poll YACS for changes and download all YACS data at once rather than sending all requests through YACS.

## This Week's Plan

I plan to evaluate the YACS v6 API, and work on individual pages on the frontend such as Grades, Schedule, etc.

## Anything Blocking?

No blockers currently.
